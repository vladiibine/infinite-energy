## 2. Infinite energy!?! Isn't that impossible?

In short: we don't know. 

Physics knows of these limitations:

1. The 1st and 2nd law of thermodinamics
2. The conservation of energy (more generally, Noether's theorem)

Our response:
1. The 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics: These laws reffer to closed systems. We don't know if our universe is a closed system. This means we don't know whether these 2 laws apply for the entire universe.
2. The law of conservation of energy: This law states that energy can't be created or destroyed. However it doesn't say whether an infinite amount of energy already exists. This law however is broken by the accelerated expansion of our universe ( https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0982 ). The Big Bang might be a phenomenon that breaks energy conservation.
