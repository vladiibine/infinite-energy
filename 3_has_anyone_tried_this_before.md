## 3. Has anyone tried to do that before?
Yes, but it's a little awoward, which is why this topic has a bad reputation among the physics community. These attempts were often made by people who ignored science, and repeatedly tried to obtain energy in ways we're pretty certain others have tried before, and failed (perpetual motion machines).

We're not aware of any initiatives like this, started by the physics scientific community.
