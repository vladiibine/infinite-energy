# The infinite Energy Initiative

This page is the current official web-site of the Infinite energy initiative.

The Infinite Energy Initiative is community of people interested in the idea of obtaining a source of infinite energy, and sharing it with everyone in a safe way.

# FAQ
## Infinite energy!?! Isn't that impossible?
### Physics knows of these limitations:
1. The 1st and 2nd law of thermodinamics
2. The conservation of energy (more generally, Noether's theorem)

### Our response:
1. The 1st and 2nd law of thermodynamics reffer to closed systems. We don't know if our universe is a closed system. Also, in case it is, we don't know whether we can make it open. We also don't know whether there lies something beyond our universe, or whether potentially, the things beyond our universe contain energy usable by us.
2. Conservation of energy - More or less as above, this law states that energy can't be created or destroyed. However it doesn't say whether an infinite amount of energy already exists, and is convertible according to our needs.
