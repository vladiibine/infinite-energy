# The Infinite Energy Initiative

This page is the current official web-site of the Infinite Energy Initiative.

The Infinite Energy Initiative is community of people interested in the idea of obtaining a source of infinite energy, and sharing it with everyone in a safe way.

# FAQ
## 1. Why do we want infinite energy? 
To prevent any disaster, and for everyone to be able to get everything they want.

## 2. Infinite energy!?! Isn't that impossible?
In short: we don't know. [Main article here](https://github.com/vladiibine/infinite-energy/blob/main/2_infinite_energy_isnt_that_impossible.md)

## 3. Has anyone tried to do that before?
Unfortunately yes, which is why this topic has a bad reputation among the physics community. These attempts were often made by people who ignored science, and repeatedly tried to obtain energy in ways we're pretty certain others have tried before, and failed (perpetual motion machines).

We're not aware of any initiatives like this, started by the physics scientific community.

## 4. How to get involved?
Glad you asked!
1. Spread the idea
2. Do on-topic research
3. Fund raising
4. Housekeeping
